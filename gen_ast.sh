# fno-builtin: Don't recognize built-in functions that do not begin with __builtin_ as prefix.
#
# ffreestanding: Assert that compilation targets a freestanding environment.  This
#        implies -fno-builtin.  A freestanding environment is one in which
#        the standard library may not exist, and program startup may not
#        necessarily be at "main".  The most obvious example is an OS
#        kernel.  This is equivalent to -fno-hosted.
#
# fdump-translation-unit-options (C++ only)
#        Dump a representation of the tree structure for the entire
#        translation unit to a file.
